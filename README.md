Desorbing Interiors via Satellite Heating to Observe Outgassing Model (DISHOOM) is a planetary evolution software designed for rocky and icy planetary bodies. 

The code estimates several known atmospheric escape mechanisms (dM/dt_plasma, dM/dt_energy-limited, dM/dt_surface-jeans, dM/dt_thermal-outgassing benchmarked to DSMC simulations and observations at Jupiter's moon Io. This is for direct application on any [exo]planet system where evaporation is occurring.

Models are also available to calculate diurnal atmospheric evolution for either:
(a) a tidally-locked satellite (e.g. Europa , Ganymede) or (b) an asynchronously rotating planet. 
^^Outputs include N [column density] versus phi [longitude] / t [time]
