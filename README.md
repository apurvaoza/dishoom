Desorbing Interiors via Satellite Heating to Observe Outgassing Model (DISHOOM) is a planetary evolution software designed for rocky and icy planetary bodies. 

The code estimates several known atmospheric escape mechanisms (dM/dt_plasma, dM/dt_energy-limited, dM/dt_surface-jeans) benchmarked to DSMC simulations and observations at Jupiter's moon Io. 


Models are also available to calculate diurnal atmospheric evolution for either (a) a tidally-locked satellite or (b) an asynchronously rotating planet. Outputs include N [column density] versus phi [longitude] / t [time]

Premade modules are available for certain solar system objects or test cases.
